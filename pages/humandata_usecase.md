## Overview

In the context of the GDPR and its country-specific implementations, the re-usability of human-subject data requires extra effort from data users as well as data providers. 
The ELIXIR RDM Toolkit offers help here with a "Human Data" use case. Specifically, this use case aims to:
  * identify key considerations for the responsible sharing of human genome-phenome data,
  * showcase a blueprint architecture for federated access to data, which needs stay within national borders,
  * demonstrate how ELIXIR toolkit components can be combined to implement federated access.
  
## Key Considerations

  * [Understanding the GDPR](./gdpr.html)
  * [Determining the sensitivity of your data](./personal_data.html)
  * Locating tools and platforms suited to handle human data

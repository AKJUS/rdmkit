## What metadata standard is appropriate for a dataset?
Find out what is the minimum information needed to adequately describe a project and a dataset early on in the project.

### Considerations
Decide at the beginning the project what are the [recommended repositories]() for your data types.
* Note that you can use several repositories if you have different data types.
* Distinguish between generic (e.g. Zenodo) and data type (technique) specific repositories (EBI repositories).

### Solutions
If you have a repository in mind:
* Go to the repository website and check under the “help” tab to find information about required metadata, usually described in the "guide" or in “how to submit” procedure.
* On the repository website, go through the submission process (try to submit some dummy data) to identify metadata requirements. For instance, if you consider publishing your transcriptomic data in ArrayExpress, you can make your metadata spreadsheet by using [Annotare 2.0 submission tool] (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/fg/annotare/), at the beginning of the project.
* Be aware that data type specific repositories usually have check-lists for metadata. For example, the European Nucleotide Archive provides [samples checklist](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/checklists) that can also be [downloaded as a spreadsheet](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/webin/sample-checklist).
* Go to generic repositories (such as Zenodo or FigShare) that usually require standard metadata. Standard metadata schema can be found at the following resources:
  * [RDA](https://rd-alliance.github.io/metadata-directory/standards/).
  * [FAIRsharing.org](https://fairsharing.org).
  * [DCC](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/standards/metadata/list).


If you don’t know yet what repository you will use:
* Go to the following resources that list metadata standards, both generic and domain specific: 
  * [RDA](https://rd-alliance.github.io/metadata-directory/standards/).
  * [FAIRsharing.org](https://fairsharing.org).
  * [DCC](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/standards/metadata/list).
  * Look for “Minimum Information ...your topic”, such as [MIAME](http://fged.org/projects/miame/) or (MINSEQE)[http://fged.org/projects/minseqe/] or [MIAPPE](https://www.miappe.org).

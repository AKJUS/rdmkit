## What metadata standard is appropriate for a dataset?
Find out what is the minimum information needed to adequately describe a project and a dataset early on in the project.

### Considerations
Decide early on in the project what is the [recommended repositories]() for your data type.
* Note that you can use several repositories if you have different data types.
* Distinguish between generic (e.g. Zenodo) and data type (technique) specific repositories (EBI repositories).

### Solutions
If you have a repository in mind:
* Go to the repository website and check under the “help” tab to find information about required metadata, usually described in manual or “how to submit” procedure.
* On the repository website, go through the submission process (try to submit some dummy data), sometime metadata requirements will pop-out. 
* Generic repositories (such as Zenodo, FigShare) usually require standard metadata that can be found at the following resources:
  * [RDA](https://rd-alliance.github.io/metadata-directory/standards/).
  * [FAIRsharing.org](https://fairsharing.org).
  * [DCC](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/standards/metadata/list).
* Data type specific repositories usually have check-lists for metadata. For example, the European Nucleotide Archive provides [samples checklist](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/checklists) that can also be [downloaded as a spreadsheet](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/webin/sample-checklist).

If you don’t know yet what repository you will use:
* Go to the following resources that list metadata standards, both generic and domain specific: 
  * [RDA](https://rd-alliance.github.io/metadata-directory/standards/).
  * [FAIRsharing.org](https://fairsharing.org).
  * [DCC](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/standards/metadata/list).
  * Look for “Minimum Information ...your topic”, such as [MIAME](http://fged.org/projects/miame/) or (MINSEQE)[http://fged.org/projects/minseqe/] or [MIAPPE](https://www.miappe.org).

## What metadata do a repository require?

Where to find metadata required by repositories?

### Considerations
* Distinguish between generic-general (E.G.: Zenodo) and data type (technique) specific repositories (EBI repositories).
* Check what are the recommended repositories for your data type (here)[].
* Notice that you can use several repositories if you have different data types.

### Solutions
* Go to the repository website and check under the “help” tab to find information about required metadata, usually described in manual or “how to submit” procedure.
* Go to the repository website and go through the submission process (try to submit some dummy data), sometime metadata requirements will pop-out 
* Generic repositories (such as Zenodo, FigShare) usually require standard metadata that can be found at the following resources:
  * [RDA](https://rd-alliance.github.io/metadata-directory/standards/)
  * [FAIRsharing.org](https://fairsharing.org)
  * [DCC](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/standards/metadata/list)
* Data type specific repositories most of the time have specific check-lists for metadata. For example, the European Nucleotide Archive provides [samples checklist](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/checklists) that can also be [downloaded as a spreadsheet](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/webin/sample-checklist).

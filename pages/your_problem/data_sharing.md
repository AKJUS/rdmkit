## Submitting your data to a public repository.

Once you have completed your experiments and are ready to submit your results for publication you may require to deposit the data in a recognised open repository prior to the article submission. Depending on the type of data you will need to find suitable repository relevant to your data type and discipline. In certain cases, your Institution or University may also provide you a centralised repository for storing the data. However, for some data types, such as the high throughput sequencing data it is essential that the data are deposited in public repositories such as ArrayExpress or Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). In these cases, only the community recognised repositories should be used.

In case a subject-specific repository is not available, you may consider to use some of the availabe general repositories.

### Considerations 
The public repository will ask you to provide various kinds of information about the data being deposited. You may be asked the following questions:
  * Is your data  personal or sensitive?
  * Is your data  commercially-sensitive?
  * Does your data contains confidential/restricted information?
  * Do you have the rights to share the data via the repository?
  * Do you have the rights or permissions to store the data? 
  * Is your data compliant with the data sharing policy of the journal?
  * Does your data follows the FAIR Data Principles?

### Solutions

#### Subject Specific Repositories

List of discipline-specific, community-recognized repositories can be found in the following links:

* [ELIXIR Recommended Deposition Databases](https://elixir-europe.org/services/tag/elixir-deposition-databases).
* [Nature Recommended Data Repositories](https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories).

#### General Repositories

## "Concrete Problem 1, Ideally Formulated as a Question"

### Description

Short explanation of what this problem is.

### Considerations

* Optional field, ideally structured in bullet points, detailing things to consider about this problem

### Solutions
* Bullet point solution 1
  * Sub-point
* Bullet point solution 2

## Can I share my data?

### Considerations
* Do you have the rights or permissions to store the data?
* Is the data commercially-sensitive?
* Does the data contain confidential/restricted information?

### Solutions


## Which repository should I use to share my data?
Once you have completed your experiments and have performed quality control of your data it is good scientific practice to share your data in a public repository. Sharing your data is often required by funders and publishers.

The most suitable repository will depend on the data type and your discipline.

### Considerations
  * What type of data are you planning to share?
  * Does the repository need to provide solutions for restricted access for sensitive data?
  * Do you have the rights to share the data via the repository?
  * How sustainability is the repository, will the data remain public over time?
  * How FAIR is the repository?
  * Does the funding agency pose specific requirements regarding data sharing?

### Solutions
If a domain-specific repository, recognised by the community, exists this should be your first choice. Domain-specific repositories often increases the FAIRness of the data.

For other cases, your Institution or University may provide a centralised repository for storing the data or you may consider to use a general repository.

#### Domain Specific Repositories
The European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) provides a tool to help you choose a suitable repository based on your data type.

#### General Repositories

## What is the best way to name a file?
 
### Description

Brief and descriptive file names are important in keeping your data files organized. A file name is the principal identifier for a file and a good name gives information what the file contains and helps in sorting them, but only if you have been consistent with the naming.

### Considerations

* Best practice is to develop a file naming convention with elements that are important to your project already when the project starts.
* When working in collaboration with others, it is important to follow the same file naming convention.

### Solutions

#### Tips for naming files
* Balance with the amount of elements: too many makes it difficult to understand vs too few makes it general.
* Order the elements from general to specific.
* Use meaningful abbreviations.
* Use underscore (_), hypen (- ) or capitalized letters to separate elements in the name. Don’t use spaces or special characters: ?!& , * % # ; * ( ) @$ ^ ~ ‘ { } [ ] < >.
* Use date format ISO8601: YYYYMMDD, and time if needed HHMMSS.
* Include a version number if appropriate: minimum two digits (V02) and extend it, if needed for minor corrections (V02-03). The leading zeros, will ensure the files are sorted correctly. 
* Write your file naming convention down and explain abbreviations in your data documentation.
* If you need to rename a lot files in order to organize your project data and manage the files easier, it is possible use applications e.g. [Bulk Rename Utility](https://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/) (Windows, free), [Renamer4Mac](https://renamer.com/) (Mac). 

#### Example elements to include in the name
* Date of creation
* Project number / Experiment / Acronym
* Type of data (Sample ID, Analysis, Conditions, Modifications etc.)
* Location / Coordinates
* Name / Initials of the creator
* Version number
* Reserve the last 3-letters for file format (e.g. .xls, .rtf, .mov, .tif, .doc)

**Examples of good file names**
* Honeybee project, experiment 2 done in Helsinki, data file created on the second of December 2020
  * File name: 20201202_HB_EXP2_HEL_DATA_V03.xls
  * Explanation: Time_Project abbreviation_ Experiment number _Location_Type of data_Version number

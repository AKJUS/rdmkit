## What kind of data do you wish to store?

There are several different types of storage solutions and depending on
what type of data you wish to store, some might be more suitable than others.
The timeline and purpose of the storage is also deciding factors for choosing
a storage solution.

### Considerations about the data
* Is your data sensitive?
* What volume of data do you need a storage solution for?
* Who will need to access the data? (Only yourself, internal or external collaborators)
* How often will the data be accessed? (Is it being actively worked on or kept as is?)
* Do you need the storage solution to be compatible with certain analysis tools?

### Considerations about storage solution
* What are the backup procedures for this storage solution?
* What are the costs associated with this storage solution?
* How sustainable is this storage solution? (How is it maintained?)

### Solutions
* Local Storage
* Cloud services
* Computer Clusters
* Possible Providers: Host Institution, National Infrastructure, EOSC, public archives, commercial providers


## How to store your data during the course of your project?

To ensure that research data are easy to find and accessible as well as the results are prepared to be reproduced and reused data should be stored already from the beginning of a project and should be kept active during the project duration. 

### Considerations
* Technical considerations and costs (storage space, in-house versions, backups etc.)
* Security and data protection rules
* Usage of standard formats, identifiers, ontologies, controlled vocabularies
* Storage of metadata from the beginning 
* Storge of all available data of an experiment (raw data, processed results, protocols, methods etc.)
* Variable access permissions and sharing definitions during the project (private data or intermediate results versus shared or published data)

### Solutions 
* FAIRDOMHub/SEEK
* iRODS

## What kind of data do you wish to store?

There are several different types of storage solutions and depending on
what type of data you wish to store, some might be more suitable than others.
The timeline and purpose of the storage is also deciding factors for choosing
a storage solution.

### Considerations about the data
* Is your data sensitive?
* What volume of data do you need a storage solution for?
* Who will need to access the data? (Only yourself, internal or external collaborators)
* How often will the data be accessed? (Is it being actively worked on or kept as is?)
* Do you need the storage solution to be compatible with certain analysis tools?

### Considerations about storage solution
* What are the backup procedures for this storage solution?
* What are the costs associated with this storage solution?
* How sustainable is this storage solution? (How is it maintained?)

### Solutions
* Local Storage
* Cloud services
* Computer Clusters
* Possible Providers: Host Institution, National Infrastructure, EOSC, public archives, commercial providers


## How to store your data during the course of your project?

To ensure that research data are easy to find and accessible as well as the results are prepared to be reproduced and reused data should be stored already from the beginning of a project and should be kept active during the project duration. 

### Considerations
* Technical considerations and costs (storage space, in-house versions, backups etc.)
* Security and data protection rules
* Usage of standard formats, identifiers, ontologies, controlled vocabularies
* Storage of metadata from the beginning 
* Storge of all available data of an experiment (raw data, processed results, protocols, methods etc.)
* Variable access permissions and sharing definitions during the project (private data or intermediate results versus shared or published data)

### Solutions 
* FAIRDOMHub/SEEK
* iPODS


## Submitting your data to a public repository.

Once you have completed your experiments and are ready to submit your results for publication you may require to deposit the data in a recognised open repository prior to the article submission. Depending on the type of data you will need to find suitable repository relevant to your data type and discipline. In certain cases, your Institution or University may also provide you a centralised repository for storing the data. However, for some data types, such as the high throughput sequencing data it is essential that the data are deposited in public repositories such as ArrayExpress or Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). In these cases, only the community recognised repositories should be used.

In case a subject-specific repository is not available, you may consider to use some of the availabe general repositories.

### Considerations 
The public repository will ask you to provide various kinds of information about the data being deposited. You may be asked the following questions:
  * Is your data  personal or sensitive?
  * Is your data  commercially-sensitive?
  * Does your data contains confidential/restricted information?
  * Do you have the rights to share the data via the repository?
  * Do you have the rights or permissions to store the data? 
  * Is your data compliant with the data sharing policy of the journal 
  * Does your data follows the FAIR Data Principles?

## Introduction

When you do research on data derived from human individuals, there are some extra aspects that you need to consider during the data life cycle.  

## Ethical and legal planning, and Collection 

### Description

To do research on human data you must follow established research ethical guidelines and legislation. Preferably planning for these aspects should be done before starting the research, and in some cases laws even demand it.

### Considerations

* Have you got an **ethical permit** for your research project?
  * To get an ethical permit you have to apply for an **ethical review** by an **ethical review board**. The legislation that governs this differs between countries. Do seek advice from your research institute.
  * Informed consents
  * International standards (GA4GH, ...)
* Data protection legislation
  * GDPR
    * [Understanding the GDPR](gdpr)
    * [Determining the sensitivity of your data](security_and_privacy)

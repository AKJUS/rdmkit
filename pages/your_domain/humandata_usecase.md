## Sharing & Reusing human data: Federated access to human data under the GDPR

### Description

In the context of the GDPR and its country-specific implementations, the re-usability of human-subject data requires extra effort from data users as well as data providers. 
The ELIXIR RDM Toolkit offers help here with a "Human Data" use case. Specifically, this use case aims to:
  * identify key considerations for the responsible sharing of human genome-phenome data,
  * showcase a blueprint architecture for federated access to data, which needs stay within national borders,
  * demonstrate how ELIXIR toolkit components can be combined to implement federated access.
  
### Considerations

  * [Understanding the GDPR](gdpr)
  * [Determining the sensitivity of your data](personal_data)
  * Locating tools and platforms suited to handle human data

### Solutions
* Bullet point solution 1

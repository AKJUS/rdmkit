## Applies to
PhD candidates, research grant applicants, project managers, group leaders, PIs

## Scenario
The funding organisation I am applying to requires a data management plan (DMP). I have little experience in writing a DMP, and I am not sure of the level of detail I am required to provide. I have limited access to data management experts within my institution. I am considering using the RDM toolkit for my data management needs. I also hope to find useful references to local training about data management requirements, data archives and DMP tools.

I know the types and the approximate amount of data I will generate, but I have not thought about how to share data with my collaborators and how to store data securely. Initially, my plan was to buy a powerful computer and portable hard drive, but I am now thinking that I need to use a national computing infrastructure. The field I work in has well defined data and curation standards, for example, capturing information (metadata) about how to collect and sample my data. However, I am not yet familiar with the importance of storing provenance data, such as tool and database versions used in analysis.


## Focus

* Write data management plans, also in the context of grant applications
* Ensure compliance with institution policy, including legal and ethical aspects
* Ensure proper data organisation and storage
* Ensure secure sharing, reproducibility and preservation of data
* Transmits the good practices in RDM to his group

## Getting started

* Check out the various steps of the [RDM life cycle](https://rdm.elixir-europe.org/index.html), in particular the [planning](https://rdm.elixir-europe.org/planning) stage

* Identify and contact the data steward in your local organisation or your national contact in the [ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/how-funded/eu-projects/converge/wp1/dm-coordinators) network
* Use local guidelines associated with the national or institutional DMP application and/or follow an introductory [training](https://tess.elixir-europe.org/search?q=Data%20Management%20Planning#materials)
* Start planning your project taking the [DMP](https://rdm.elixir-europe.org/data_management_plan.html) into account 

## Common issues

Some common issues and solutions that researchers run into are listed here:
* How do I know if my data is [sensitive](https://rdm.elixir-europe.org/data_classification.html) and how to ensure [data protection](https://rdm.elixir-europe.org/data_protection.html) and [compliance](https://rdm.elixir-europe.org/compliance_monitoring.html)?
* What are suitable resources for data computation and [storage](https://rdm.elixir-europe.org/storage.html) during the project, considering size of data and who has access rights?
* How do I best capture the [processes](https://rdm.elixir-europe.org/data_analysis.html) involved in creating, processing and analysing my data?
* What are best practices for [organising](https://rdm.elixir-europe.org/data_organisation.html) my data?
*How can I ensure research [data quality](https://rdm.elixir-europe.org/data_quality.html)?
*In which public repository should I [share](https://rdm.elixir-europe.org/sharing) and [publish](https://rdm.elixir-europe.org/data_publication.html) my data? 
*How do I find appropriate standard [metadata](https://rdm.elixir-europe.org/metadata_management.html) for my data?
*What metadata and community standards do I need to [capture](https://rdm.elixir-europe.org/collecting) to enable FAIR-publi*shing in public repositories?
*What are the data retention policies for [my country](https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/how-funded/eu-projects/converge/wp1/dm-coordinators)?

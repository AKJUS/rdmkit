## Role title

Sys administration, HPC support, Cloud brokerage

## My background
My name is Peter Brown. I studied Engineering at Bristol University. I am interested in building system. I am very competent in unix, system administration, network management, cloud computing, security monitoring? 
Inter-process communication, threads and programming for the HPC is also an interest of mine.


## Main duties

 * setting-up environments, 
 * storage management, 
 * authorization and identifications.

## Common data issues I encounter

 * How can I find good templates / best practices on data storage, backup, recovery and on how to store/organise data and software on the folder tree.
 * How much compute and storage resources, and of what type, will a project need? (considering type of data, number of samples, applications used)
 * What kind of storage is needed for compute for different use cases? (fast, slow, local, distributed)
 * What type of data (access) management system I need to support on our infrastructure? (i.e iRods, etc)
 * How can data safely be transferred from a data provider to the compute resource I manage? 
 * What are appropriate procedures and technical requirements for processing sensitive data? 
 * What other the compute services are available for performing analysis on (sensitive) data?
 * What are available technical solutions to make data available to external collaborators?
 * What are good practices for preserving compute environments?
 * What tools are available to create analysis pipelines?
 * What are the tools that can be used to manage dependencies resolve software package version conflicts?

## What is Data Sharing?
Data Sharing means making datasets known and available to the global research community and to society at large. Data sharing can be done at any time during the researcj data life cycle, but at the latest data should be made available at the time of publication of articles that use the data to make scientific conclusions. 

## Why Data Sharing is important?
Sharing of data is a cornerstone of modern research. It is ethical good research  practice to ensure that data underlying research is preserved and made available to anyone, preferably in a way that adheres to the [FAIR principles](). 

Eventhough all data might not be possible to share openly, strive to make data "_as open as possible, as closed as necessary_".


* Good reasons to open access to your datasets.
  * [European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity (2017)](https://www.allea.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ALLEA-European-Code-of-Conduct-for-Research-Integrity-2017.pdf) states that “Researchers, research institutions and organisations ensure access to data is as open as possible, as closed as necessary”.
  * Research funders, institutions and reputable journals/publishers with data sharing mandates will normally allow you to opt out of their open data requirements only for legitimate reasons (see below).
  * Additional reasons to share your datasets:
    - [Ten reasons to share your data.](https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/ten-reasons-to-share-your-data)
    - [Ask not what you can do for open data; ask what open data can do for you.](http://blogs.nature.com/naturejobs/2017/06/19/ask-not-what-you-can-do-for-open-data-ask-what-open-data-can-do-for-you/)
* Good reasons to close or restrict access to your datasets.
  - Ethical issues.
  - Personal data.
  - Sensitive data that could potentially cause harm (e.g. to endangered species, vulnerable sites or groups, public health, national security…) if made public. Some personal data are considered sensitive personal data.
  - Legal or contractual issues:
    - Confidential data (you have a duty or agreed to keep the data confidential).
    - Third-party data (data are not generated in the course of your own research project, but are supplied to you by another party).  
    - Copyright and/or database right data.
    - Data with potential economic/commercial value.

If you want to close or restrict access to your datasets, you must explain your ethical and/or legal issues in the Data Management Plan. You can ask help to the Legal Team, Tech Transfer Office or Data Protection Officer of your institute.


## What should be considered for Data Sharing?

* Take Data Sharing into consideration already at the [Planning stage](planning). Don't leave it to the last stage. 
* Making the data as FAIR as possible will ensure that the most value can be made out of it in the future.
  - The easiest way to make data FAIR is to deposit it in a publicly accessible recognised repository.
  - If there are Dicipline-specific repositories available for you data, this should be your primary choice. They will work towards a high level of FAIRness by recommending appropriate community standards for describing the data. 
  - Your second choice should be your Institutional repository, if there is one.
  - The last choice is to deposit the data in a [general purpose repository](https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories#general).
* Consider depositing your data to a repository as early as possible. This saves a lot of trouble later on.
* To make your life easier, structure the metadata according to your target repositories early on in the project (see Planning).
* Note that all data might not be possible to make publicly available because of ethical, legal, contractual, or intellectual property reasons. 
  - For some data types there are repositories that can harbour data that will be under controlled access.
  - 
  
* For finding appropriate repositories by type of data, there are extensive lists and selection tools in the following locations:
  - For Biomolecular Data in Life Science use one of the [ELIXIR Deposition Databases](https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/data/elixir-deposition-databases), or use the [EBI Guidance Wizard](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/submission/)
  - [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/)
  - [Re3data](https://re3data.org/)
  - [Repositories recommended by Nature publishing group](https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories)
  - For the sharing of human-subject phenotype/genotype data there are well-established repositories ([EGA](https://ega-archive.org/), [dbGAP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/), [JGA](https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/jga/index-e.html)). 
    - The choice will depend on the conditions under which data has been donated and the legislative/geographic boundaries for the research project/consortium. There are also community-specific data hubs that may implement a controlled-access model e.g. ORPHANET, MJFF.

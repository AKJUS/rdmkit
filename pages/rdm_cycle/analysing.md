## What is Data Analysis?
Data analysis is the step where the actual work on the data towards the goal of a research project takes place. The steps of the workflow in the Analysis phase of a project often will be repeated several times to explore the data as well as to optimize the process.

Data analysis follows the (often automated, batch) processing in the Processing stage.

## Why is Data Analysis important?
Data Analysis is the main reason for a data intensive project. It actually works towards achieving the goal.

## What should be considered for Data Analysis?
* Provenance: it is important that the exact steps that have been taken in the data analysis are documented. This includes the exact version of the software used, as well as any parameters. Manual "manipulation" of the data may complicate this documentation process.
* Who will be doing the analysis? Will it be a computer wizard, or a subject matter expert? In the first case, a series of tools that can be used from the unix command line may give a lot of flexibility, in the latter case a workflow system (such as Galaxy) may be better.

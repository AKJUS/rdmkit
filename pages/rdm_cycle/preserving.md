## What is preserving?

Preservation refers to reliable preservation of digital information for several decades or centuries. Hardware, software and file formats get outdated, and correct preservation prevents your data from being lost. Preservation aims to keep the content (data) and the context (metadata) usable for far future reuse.

Preservation of digital information requires planning, policies, resources (time, funds, people) as well as the right technology to ensure that the data stays functional and that it can be accessed. Hence, special long term data repositories should be used for digital preservation, where the data is actively maintained and information integrity is monitored.

## Why is preserving important?

Data that has significant value for example to an organization, nationally or globally should be preserved long term.

Digital data is dependent on technology to access, read and render the data, thus making it vulnerable to being lost if not preserved correctly. Software and hardware become obsolete as time progresses. Bits may degrade or become corrupted over time - so called [bit rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_degradation). Insufficient documentation can make it impossible to interpret the data.

## What should be considered when preserving data?

When preserving digital data

* choose a data deposition repository that provides long term preservation
* select what part of your data should be preserved long term and what can be deleted
* ensure well described and self-explanatory documentation
* include information about provenance
* include sufficient licensing information
* ensure that data is well organized
* ensure that a consistent naming scheme is used 
* use standard, open source, file formats instead of proprietary ones

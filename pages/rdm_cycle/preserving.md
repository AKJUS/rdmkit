## What is Data Preserving?

Preservation refers to reliable preservation of digital information for several decades or centuries. Hardware, software and file formats get outdated, and correct preservation prevents your data from being lost . Preservation aims to keep the content (data) and the context (metadata) usable for far future reuse.

Preservation of digital information requires planning, policies, resources (time, funds, people) as well as the right technology to ensure that the data stays functional and it can be accessed. Hence, special long term data repositories should be used for digital preservation, where the data is actively maintained and information integrity is monitored.


## Why is Data Preserving is important?

Data that has significant value for example to an organization, nationally or globally should be preserved for long term.

Digital data is dependent on technology making it at great risk of being lost if not preserved correctly.  One reason for loss of data over time can be connected to inherent features for data storage media - so call [bit rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_degradation).


## What should be considered for Preserving Data?

When preserving digital data

* choose a data deposition repository that provides long term preservation
* select what part of your data should be preserved for long term and what can be deleted
* ensure well described and self-explanatory [metadata](metadata_management)
* data should be well organized
* data should be named with a consistent naming scheme
* file formats should be considered carefully
* include information about provenance
* include sufficient licensing information

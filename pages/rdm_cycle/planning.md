## What is Data Management Planning?
Data management planning means that it is well thought through how data is managed and organized during and after a project. This should be done by making a Data Management Plan (DMP), which is a document completing your research plan. 

Data management plan describes how data is managed through out the project life cycle.

## Why Data Management Planning is important?
It is good research practice to take care of your research data and have a data management plan. 

Data management planning

* helps to plan and budget necessary resources and equipment
* facilitates to identify responsibilities and roles of project participants involved
* helps you to identify data handling related issues before they arise
* is often a requirement of research organisation's and funders.
* enables efficient preservation, sharing and re-use


## What should be considered for Data Management Planning?
Data management is best planned in the early stages of a research project, but a DMP is a living document and you should updated it when necessary as the research project progresses. Often funders require you to provide a DMP as part of the application, or latest when your project is funded.

There are many guidelines, policies and tools for data management planning. Find recommendations and obtain help from your home institution. 


### Deciding for a DMP tool

It is recommended to use web-based DMP tools, that provide both templates and guidance how to answer the questions. Tools usually also allow you to share the DMP with your collaborators as well as export it in many formats. 

Some tools support machine actionable DMPs (maDMP), which enable you to transfer information between different tools and systems. 
MaDMPs aim to make the DMP interoperable, automated and increasingly standardised.

DMP can also be written as a simple text document, if preferred.

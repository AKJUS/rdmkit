## What is Data Management Planning?
Data management planning means that it is well thought through how data is managed and organized during and after a project. This should be done by making a Data Management Plan (DMP), which is a document completing your research plan. Data management plan describes the data types in a project and how they are managed at different stages in the project and who can access the data.


## Why Data Management Planning is important?
It is good research practice to take care of your research data and have a data management plan. It will make your work more efficient, facilitate team work and use of services and tools.

Data management planning:

* helps to plan and budget necessary resources and equipment.
* defines roles and responsibilities in data management among the project team.
* helps to identify risks in data handling and apply solutions at early stage.
* facilitates data sharing, re-use and preservation.
* is often a requirement of research organisation's and funders'.


## What should be considered for Data Management Planning?
Data management should be planned in the early stages of a research project. Preferably the DMP should be done before you start collecting data. However, DMP is a living document, which should be updated when the research project progresses. Often funders require you to provide a DMP as part of the application, or latest when your project is funded.

There are many guidelines, policies and tools for data management planning. Find recommendations and obtain help from your home institution support services.


### Deciding for a DMP tool

It is recommended to use web-based DMP tools, that provide both templates and guidance how to answer the questions. Tools usually also allow you to share the DMP with your collaborators as well as export it in many formats.

Some tools support machine actionable DMPs (maDMP), which enable you to transfer information between different tools and systems.
MaDMPs aim to make the DMP interoperable, automated and increasingly standardised.

DMP can also be written as a simple text document, if preferred.

This is the main tool and resource list of our website. This is a curated list which means that not all tools or resources that exist for a certain topic are listed here. This is mainly because we do not intend to be a registry. In most cases this will only be the ones that are mentioned in pages. Most pages will show a filtered list of this main table at the end of the page. Tools and resources are manually linked to bio.tools and FAIRsharing. The link with TeSS is automatically made and weekly updated. If you see a missing link with one of the registries (bio.tools, FAIRsharing and TeSS) or a mistake, please open an [issue](https://github.com/elixir-europe/rdm-toolkit/issues) or check our [how to add a tool or resource guide](tool_resource_update).

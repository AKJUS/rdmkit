## What?
Many datasets could exist that you can re-use for your project. Even if you know the literature very well, you can not assume that you know everything that is available. Data sets that you should be looking for can either have been collected for the same purpose in a previous project, but it could also have been collected for a completely different purpose and still serve your goals.

## Why?
It is not because we can generate massive amounts of data that we always need to do so. Creating data with public money is bringing with it the responsibility to treat those data well and (if potentially useful) make them available for re-use by others. And the circle is only complete if such data is actually re-used.

## When?
Before you decide which data to create yourself.

## How?

### Finding existing data

#### Considerations
* You should consider whether there are recommended repositories for the type of data you are searching for
* You should consider whether the type of data you are searching for is straightforward to reuse (e.g. genome data) or requires extensive metadata to interpret and reuse (e.g. gene expression experiment data)
* You should keep in mind whether the repositories provide sufficient metadata to enable data reuse
* You should consider whether the data you are interested in may have sensitivity or privacy issues
* You should consider whether the data you are interested in have any licencing issues/restrictions

#### Tools
For finding data in public repositories per type of data, first consult the corresponding question in the toolkit (link to depositing data question here) to identify suitable repositories, then search for data within that repository

For looking for data through journal searches, you can use the following tools:
* [Europe PMC/PubMed](https://europepmc.org/)
* [BASE](https://www.base-search.net/)
* [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/)
* [Web of Science](http://webofknowledge.com)

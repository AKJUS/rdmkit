## What planning means
Data management planning means thinking about how research data will be managed during and after the project. The way researchers expect to manage the data has to be written in a Data Management Plan (DMP) document. In DMP, the definition of research data is...

## Why planning is important
Data management planning will facilitate the progress of your project, as you can prepare early on. Data management planning will also help you to get funded, as this is a critical part of the proposal and/or the contract for many funders and a good DMP will show and improve the feasibility of your project.

## When planning should be done
Data management planning is best performed before starting a project. Often funders require a DMP with the application, during the contracting phase and when concluding a project. Data management planning is not a once in a life-time effort for a project, it is a continuous process supporting your project.

## How planning could be done
There are many guidelines, policies and tools to assist you with data management planning. This is very dependent on your local legislation, the funding body and institution. Below you can find some guidelines to navigate this.

### Choose a DMP template
#### Considerations
Usually, funders and/or universities and institutions require specific DMP templates. If there are no recommended templates, you can choose a generic one.
#### Solutions
* Use the DMP template suggested by your funder or university as first choice. Here there is a list of DMP templates required by European funding agencies.
  * [ERC](http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/gm/reporting/h2020-erc- tpl-oa-data-mgt-plan_en.odt)
* You can use a generic DMP template if specific requirements are not in place. Here the links to good generic templates.
  * ...

### Choose a tool to write your DMP
#### Considerations
DMP can be written simply by using the downloaded template in a text document format. However, we recommend using dedicated web-based tools because they usually contain several DMP templates and provide guidance to help you interpret and answer the questions.
#### Solutions
* Use the tool suggested by your funder as first choice.
* Use the tool suggested by your university/institution.
* Here we list some web-based tools that you can use to write a DMP, independently of your Country or discipline. Additional tools can be found in the "Tools" table at the end of this page.

### What to write in the DMP
#### Considerations  
Numerous aspects of data management need to be addressed in a DMP, therefore it is important to be aware of the current best practices before start writing.
#### Solutions
Best practices and guidelines about different aspects of research data management will be provided in this toolkit. Moreover, a list of resources and training material can be found at the end of the page. Use the following links to find best practices and guidelines about each topic.

## Copyright best practices

The content of this website should be unique, with text and images especially created for the site. The site aims to be authoritative and informative, and not a pastiche of other resources.

### Text

Text on this website should either be unique or be properly attributed. If you want to quote from another source, like a website or publication, then enclose the quote within quotation marks, keep the exact words, and link to the resource. Mention the name of the resource to give clear credit, and give the full citation for a publication. Please do not copy the text and tweak the wording slightly. If you are not giving the exact quote, then you must express the concept in your own words.

Please do not include long quotations from other sources. Again, we aim to make the content on this site unque.

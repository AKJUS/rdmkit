## Google Doc Way

The toolkit is hosted on Github. We appreciate that many people are inexperienced and uncomfortable about using Github. Besides, it’s hard to see what you are doing when struggling with it. 
 
So instead, to propose or take the lead on a section.
 
* Copy the template [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gYS3vjiCIBQv5p3Fn8_d97qfIHRLbwUyMadnkaEGa1I/edit?usp=sharing) and name it with the section name 
* [Email the editorial team](....@elixir-europe.org) when you are done or you have enough for them to start with, i.e. your document doesn’t have to be perfect
* The editorial team will lift the text into the handbook and let you know when that is done
* Iterate with the editorial team to tweak

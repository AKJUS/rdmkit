## Contribution process

The toolkit is hosted on Github. We understand, however, that many people may be unfamiliar or inexperienced with git. We therefore provide the Google doc option for contributing. This process is sketched below.

The steps to be followed by contributors are as follows:
* [Email the editorial team](mailto:enquiries@rdm.elixir-europe.org) to propose a new page or a new section in an existing page. Make sure you keep other contributors in the CC of your email.
* The editors will create an issue in the GitHub repository in order make your prospective contribution known to others.  
* The editors will create an empty page using our [google doc template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gYS3vjiCIBQv5p3Fn8_d97qfIHRLbwUyMadnkaEGa1I/edit?usp=sharing) and share it with you.
* Add your content to the empty page.
* [Email the editorial team](mailto:enquiries@rdm.elixir-europe.org) when you are done.
* The editors will assign reviewers to your page, who will provide feedback as comments on your google doc based page.
* Address reviewers'comments and let the editorial team know by mail that you're done.
* The editors will transfer your page to GitHub and let you know when the page is merged to website.

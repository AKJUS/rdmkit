* **Github way:** We use GitHub to develop the RDM toolkit website. GitHub allows us to accept and coordinate contributions under an open authoring and review process. Therefore, this is our preferred way of accepting contributions. To begin with, you will need a personal GitHub account, which you can create on the [GiHub Join page](https://github.com/join).   
* **Google Doc way:** Alternatively, we provide Google Doc templates. This approach requires you to email our editors, who will transfer your content to our git repository for you.

## Contributor responsibilities

When writing for this website keep in mind the following:

* For the sake of consistency, please follow our [style guide](https://rdm.elixir-europe.org/style_guide.html).
* We give great importance to authorship credit. If others were involved in your contribution, by writing up or by providing resources such as diagrams/links, please make sure you acknowledge them in the authors' section of your page.

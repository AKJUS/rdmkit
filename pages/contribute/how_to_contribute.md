* **Github way:** We use git to develop the RDM toolkit website. Git allows us to accept and coordinate contributions under an open authoring and review process. Therefore, GitHub is our preferred way of accepting contributions.  
* **Google Doc way:** For those contributors that are not versed in git, we provide Google Doc templates. This approach requires e-mail communication with our editors, who will be responsible for transferring the content to our git repository on your behalf.

## Contributor responsibilities

Regardless of your chosen way of contributing, please keep in mind the following when writing content for this website:

* For the sake of consistency please follow our style-guide when writing.
* We give great importance to authorship credit. If others were involved in your contribution, by writing-up or by providing resources such as diagrams/links please make sure they are acknowledged in the authors section of your page.
